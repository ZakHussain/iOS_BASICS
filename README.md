#Description of each APPS
=========================

###(1) Cold Call
	Working with the UI is a fundamental part of iOS development. Cold call implements simple user interface design in the storyboard. This interface includes pressing a button labeled “Cold Call” and having the screen display a person’s name, and a number at random.

###(2) IOS_hackathon_fleeing_detroit
	Fleeing Detroit is an adventure game that provides a player a chance to traverse the treacherous, post-apocalyptic world of Detroit in the year 10005. 
	This app incorporates navigation between multiple view controllers, and makes use of many random occurrences. You have less than a 5% chance of surviving. Sadly, graphics and many features have not been completed to create the full visual for the game. 
	I plan to come back to a game like this once I have grasped a stronger understanding of Natural Language Processing, to build an AI Narrator that guides the adventure!

###(3)IOSQuiz
	I created this mini quiz as a means of reviewing key concepts in iOS development. There is an array of questions that are pulled from. The user has the option of seeing the answer after they have pondered on it.

###(4)NinjaGold
	This app is based on an earlier application I had made to practice using python frameworks. For this app, the user has a choice to gain gold from selecting to farm, stay in a cave, stay in a house, or being at a casino. Of course, casino’s being a place of gambling means the player can lose gold here. 
	The purpose of this app was to get a better understanding of creating onClick functions to respond to user actions.

###(5) ttt (tic-tac-toe)
	A simple game of tic-tac-toe on a 4x4 grid. Though, I haven’t gotten a chance to complete the reset, or signal winner features.
